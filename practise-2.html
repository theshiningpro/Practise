	<h1>Babar Azam is not in Kohli's mind</h1>

		<p><h3>It was predicted that Babar Azam would tour England for Pakistan. Babur started the work of making it come true from the very beginning. The great Pakistan batsman is on the first day of the first Test which started yesterday at Old Trafford in Manchester. Pakistan did well for Babar and Shan Masood on the first rainy day. Pakistan scored 139 runs for 2 wickets. Of these, Babar's collection is 79 off 100 balls. Masood made 46 off 152 balls. The Pakistan team had a fairly good first day with a pair of 96 runs. Babur was great for any trial. Zafra Archer, Chris Broad, Jimmy Anderson or Dom Bass have played with authority. Every shot was great. Sometimes Broad-Anderson flicked the ball over the middle stump, sometimes hit the ball outside the off stump to cover drive. Whether it's offensive or defensive, Babur has turned the stick on the bowlers. Each of the 11 boundaries was dazzling, a full display of his talent. The first day at Old Trafford was completely taken over by one of the best batsmen in Pakistan. But according to former England captain and Sky Sports commentator Nasser Hossain, Babar is not getting the full attention he deserves. But if Virat Kohli had been in his place, there would have been a lot of fuss about him. Nasser Hossain came to the commentary and said the words straightforwardly. If it was Kohli, there would have been a lot of talk about him. But since the batsman is Babur, it is as if everyone is stingy in praising him. However, we are not stingy in giving that compliment to Babar. 'He highlighted Babar's career statistics and said that this Pakistani batsman is no less than Kohli,' Since 2016, Babar has averaged 8 in Tests and 55 in limited overs cricket. She’s young, she’s great. He has all the royal affairs. ' There are currently four cricketers known as the 'Fab Four' in cricket — Virat Kohli, Ken Williamson, Joe Root and Steve Smith. Nasser Hussein is talking about transforming it into ‘Fab Five’ by adding Babar to the team, ‘Everyone is talking about Fab Four. But in my opinion the word is fab five. And Babur is one of the members of this team. 'He said it was unfortunate that the Pakistan cricket team could not play on home soil. According to him, the Pakistan cricket team is always lost under the shadow of the Indian cricket team, ‘It is unfortunate that Pakistan cannot play at home. They play home series in the UAE with the door closed. The game of Pakistani cricketers does not catch the eye of the spectators. I think the Pakistan cricket team is always lost under the shadow of the Indian cricket team. They can't play in the IPL, they don't even get a chance to play against India.</h3> '
